[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmessage_filter.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "message_filter", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "message_filter"
  with any of the following names:

    message_filterConfig.cmake
    message_filter-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "message_filter" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "message_filter_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "message_filter" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
